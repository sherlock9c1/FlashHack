Beta 0.2 (04/10/20)
Merge all existing code bases and clean up.
No version control or changelog previous to this version.

Beta 0.4 (04/12/20)
Implement recovery rom patch, bin compare, and improve progress display.  Repair mapping algorithm.  Lots of other small bug fixes.

Beta 0.4.1 (04/14/20)
Try a less precise connection routine that might work with B and Y body cars.

Beta 0.4.2 (04/14/20)

Move the RESET ECM button to the main page and change its logic so it may work properly.

Beta 0.4.3 (04/17/20)
Add configuration and some more repairs to the bus master routine.

Beta 0.5.0 (04/18/20)
Add a raw command tester for the hell of it.
Move EE to a preload and call model for all write/erase/VPP executable code (thanks kur4o for your help with this!) this means that we only have a 9 byte command to run any routine.
Reduce ALDL read buffer size during times of extreme bus noise to avoid having too much to clear.
Handle ALDL usb disconnect better.

Beta 0.5.1 (04/19/20)
Some prep done for implementation of V6 stuff.
Externalize loading headers instead of inlining them.
Revert some changes related to the bus master routine.

Beta 0.5.2
Improve program storage/retrieval
Resume bus master traffic after finishing operation and improve some other ALDL logic
Fix some kernel unloading logic so things reset faster
Beta P66 V6 flash support

Beta 0.5.3
Redo bus connection logic again

Beta 0.5.4
Code cleanup.
Handle some edge cases and add failsafes in bus connection logic.
Re-enable confirmation of serial echo integrity.

Beta 0.5.5
Enable optional fast connnection logic for good serial interfaces (see configuration menu)
Enable some really basic machine learning for connection predelay
Add version number to the log
Add interface specific configuration function to avoid dynamic allocation of port and too many checks.
Optimize some byte level functions for readability and speed.

Beta 0.5.6
Improve the advanced section a bit and move some stuff around
Add a close interface function
Add warnings for EEB bin where the recovery rom will not work on the ESIDE
Add ALDL keepalive
Add a flag to slow down ALDL comms for shitty interfaces
Fix some more bugs in P66 flash (still not ready)
Fix bug that stopped serial interface info from populating the log

Beta 0.5.7
Fix an off-by-one error in the progress visualizer so it will draw all the way to the end
Simplify the log levels a bit and add a switch to disable auto-scroll
Improve layout, add dynamic splitter between log and controls etc
Try a different keepalive as the other one seems to wake a CCM up
More improvements to P66 support
Add P66 selective write
Code cleanup and organization

Beta 0.5.8
Fix two P66 files that were broken and prevented the kernel from loading
Restore the function that remembers the last read bin in EE

Beta 0.5.9
Fix a few c++ casts that prevent it from building with some compilers
Add a workaround so the EE e-side recovery patch will work if you have an already FF patched bin
Fix P66 read

Beta 0.6.0
Remove the warnings from the P66 flash tool so people are less scared of it
Rearrange the UI a bit so it's more contextual
Validate calibration ID
Use existing cal ID or vin from loaded bin if available
More code cleanup

Beta 0.6.1
Remember last selected ECM as default
Provide menu option to select new ECM
Add a workaround for the E-Side comms patch
Add unique vehicle identifier to EE
Use .bin extension properly in save/load dialogs

Beta 0.6.2
Start integrating OBDX Pro
Fix bug in vehicle identifier for EE

Beta 0.6.3
Fix reset timing bug in EE that made it a pain to reset the TSide
Verify the reset vector in EE doesn't point somewhere shitty
More work with OBDX Pro

Beta 0.6.4
Make read/write block size arbitrary
Move the mode 2 read function into its own module and remove it from the advanced tab
Add numerical parameters to the flash processors
Add an option to not resume normal traffic on interface close
Remove some redundant operations in the flash UI
Big red error notification bar above the log to get the users attention
More UI polish
